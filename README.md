# SLGT22

On-screen graphics and stream management package for the Superliminal Glitchless Tournament (2022) hosted during Spring/Summer 2022 on [twitch.tv/speedyliminal](https://twitch.tv/speedyliminal) This is not intended to be used as-is and will not deploy without major additional work. Use for inspiration and at your own risk.

This contains the entire NodeCG instance due to tight integration with speedcontrol.
